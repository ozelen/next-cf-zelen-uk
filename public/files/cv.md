# Work Experience

## Solution/Enterprise Architect, Consultant, Researcher

*Self-employed, JKO Connect (contract-based) | August 2023 – Present*

My most recent and impactful experience as an architect has been with JKO Connect, a consultancy where I helped clients overcome their most pressing technical challenges. Fintech and iGaming companies relied on me not only for architecture expertise, but also for guidance through their most complex digital transformations.

### Agentic AI Projects

After years as an IT consultancy, JKO Connect pivoted to an Agentic AI company, where I led the infrastructure and delivery of PoCs for AI agentic workflows in the **Legal and Compliance industry**. I designed and implemented **cost-efficient cloud infrastructure** and **CI/CD pipelines** to enable rapid delivery of tailored solutions for prospective clients. I also partnered with technical product managers to shape requirements and transformed vibecoded prototypes into **stable, production-ready software systems**

#### Tech stack

- LangChain/LangGraph  
- Python/Django  
- Terraform/Terragrunt  
- AWS  
- Postgres  
- PGVector

### Fintech project. From consultant to fractional Head of Engineering

When I joined as a consultant and architect, my work from a short-term technical advisor quickly grew into a mix of strategy, leadership, hands-on design, to a top management role in the client company. An Irish fintech company was stuck with a new platform being underdeveloped and the team was cut, CTO was leaving the company. C-levels were panicking. A small and demotivated development team of three people was left with three different platforms in three different tech stacks (.NET on Azure, Java/AWS on AWS EC2, and Golang/Serverless), with poor infra setup, outdated documentation, and poor communication between the business and technical team.

My role was to **assess the project** and **design a cost-effective solution** that would minimize the risks of knowledge loss and operational disruption, and require less of operational resources. I delivered an **Architecture Vision documentation** outlining a detailed technical assessment of all platforms, a consolidation plan with estimates, roadmap, and a proposed team structure to meet SLA requirements while improving collaboration between developers and business stakeholders.

Once the plan was approved, I took **ownership of architecture governance**, **technical leadership, and the hiring process**. With the right people in place, we stabilized and hardened the core platform while deprecating costly legacy components, and minimized “KTLO” workload. This restored trust between business and engineering, and enabled the company to shift focus toward delivering new products with confidence.

When the Lead Engineering Manager left, I stepped in to cover his responsibilities for six months, ensuring continuity and knowledge transfer until the new Head of Engineering was hired and fully onboarded.

#### Tech Stack

- .NET  
- Java  
- Golang  
- React  
- AngularJS  
- AWS  
- Azure  
- Github Actions

### iGaming project. Optimization of User Path

An iGaming platform with multiple integrated products (casino and sportsbook) was facing high latency and failure rates due to excessive redirects, global traffic distribution, and regional restrictions.

As an **Enterprise Solution Architect**, I investigated the issue and proposed a multi-phase solution to improve performance and availability. This required a cross-domain analysis across infrastructure, business processes, and product teams.

My recommendations included creating new business units and roles, introducing new software components with B2B SaaS potential, and implementing deep infrastructure optimizations.

#### Results:

- Traffic loss in problematic regions decreased from 20% to 0.5%.  
- User hop time improved from seconds to milliseconds.  
- The company gained the ability to automatically respond to domain blockages, ensuring continuous availability.

#### Tech stack

- Golang  
- Kubernetes  
- Terraform  
- AWS  
- CloudFlare Workers  
- TOGAF  
- Archimate
